You can mention BLYRIC on a tweet to request an album to compose the lyrics base. You can do it just mentioning our username and writing the album name in the same tweet, just like this:

Once tweeted, BLYRIC will search in [Genius website](https://genius.com/) if there is an album like this tweet. If so, it will register this album into the database, and a lyric of this album can be sorted.  
When registered, BLYRIC also tweets the new album that was registered, like this:
